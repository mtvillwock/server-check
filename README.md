# Deploy Check

As a developer, product manager, or QA tester, you've likely run into a scenario where unexpected behavior occurs.
Some times the cause it due to attempting to test Feature A when the code for it is only in Environment B.
This gem/CLI tool (TBD) aims to provide transparency for anyone who is curious as to what code branches are where.

## What code is where?

Branches. Environments. Servers. Tickets.

How to make sure everything is aligned?

Use Deploy Check to see what branches for which tickets are deployed to what environments on which servers.
